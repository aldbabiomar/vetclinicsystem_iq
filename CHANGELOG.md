# Changelog

All notable changes to Vetzone IQ are documented in this file, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) style.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- In-app update checker (Settings → Updates) that pulls tagged GitHub
  Releases, backs up the database first, and rolls back automatically if
  a new version fails its health check.
- Cash Received / Change Due fields on the POS checkout screen.
- A heads-up when a Price List entry isn't a multiple of 250 IQD.

### Changed
- Bill totals, balances, refunds, boarding/inpatient totals, and
  consignment settlement payouts now round to the nearest 250 IQD note —
  the smallest banknote in circulation — instead of showing unpayable
  fractional amounts.
- Revenue reports now read the same rounded, final total shown on the
  receipt instead of recomputing it, so reports and receipts always
  agree to the dinar.
- `is_system`, `is_vet_role`, `active`, `must_change_password`,
  `can_discount`, `track_expiry`, `special_needs`, `dismissed`,
  `restocked`, and `liability_overridden` are now native boolean columns
  instead of 0/1 integers.
